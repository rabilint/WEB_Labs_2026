        <strong>Fairy</strong>
        <i style="white-space: pre-line ; font-family: Fairy">
                Over hill, over dale,
                Thorough bush, thorough brier,
                Over park, over pale,
                Thorough flood, thorough fire,
                I do wander everywhere,
                Swifter than the moon's sphere;
                And I serve the fairy queen,
                To dew her orbs upon the green.
                The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
                In their gold coats spots you see;
                Those be rubies, fairy favours,
                In those freckles live their savours:
                I must go seek some dewdrops here
                And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
                Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:
                Our queen and all our elves come here anon.

        <i style="white-space: pre-line ; font-family: PUCK">
            The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
            Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
            For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
            Because that she as her attendant hath
            A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
            She never had so sweet a changeling;
            And jealous Oberon would have the child
            Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
            But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
            Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
            And now they never meet in grove or green,
            By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
            But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
            Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there
